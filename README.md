# Sustainable Language Technology üåçüíª

This project explores the intersection of **language technology** and **environmental impact**, investigating how conventional programming approaches can serve as a more energy-efficient alternative to machine learning methods.  

The primary outcome is a **C-program for word classification** that demonstrates lower energy consumption compared to machine learning‚Äìbased solutions.

## üìñ Project Overview
The motivation for this project comes from the rising carbon footprint of modern computing, particularly in **machine learning**.  
Our objective was to design a language technology tool using conventional programming techniques that:  
- Performs **word classification**,  
- Operates with a **minor carbon footprint**,  
- And provides insights into the trade-offs between conventional methods and machine learning.
